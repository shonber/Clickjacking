/* __Explanation_
* The Style is for hiding and positioning the iframe for the clickjacking. The opacity in real life is 0, but for demostration you can change it to a higher value.
* "<iframe src="http://192.168.1.2:4444/likes.php?action="></iframe>" This code is for creating an iframe with the vulnerable site and the paramter is for removing the error and positioning the like button under the scam button.
* "<a href="" target="_blank">CLICK ME!</a>" is for refreshing the page for more likes each click.
* ATTENTION: THe like button on the vulnerable site is kinda small so the attack site button will work only if you clic kthe left side of it (test to see).
